# Empowering Wellness: Bellabeat Fitness Data Analysis || SQL & Power BI 

Imagine working with a leading wellness technology company dedicated to empowering women through innovative health and fitness solutions. With a mission to enhance user well-being, understanding how customers interact with fitness data is crucial. This project dives into FitBit fitness tracker data to uncover trends, analyze user behavior, and provide actionable insights to drive Bellabeat's product and marketing strategies. 

<h3 class="major">Objective</h3>
This project focuses on analyzing fitness data using SQL for data preparation and Power BI for visualization. By exploring metrics such as daily activity, sleep patterns, and calorie expenditure, we aim to identify trends, understand user behavior, and provide data-driven recommendations to enhance Bellabeat's offerings. 

<h3 class="major">Chapters</h3>
This project involved analyzing FitBit fitness tracker data by first cleaning and processing the dataset in SQL to ensure accuracy by handling duplicates and missing values. The analysis explored daily activity metrics—such as steps, distance, and calories—categorizing users into activity levels (Sedentary, Light Active, Moderately Active, Very Active), while sleep patterns were assessed to determine efficiency and improvement opportunities. Additionally, calorie expenditure trends were examined and linked to activity levels, with users segmented into Low, Medium, and High burn groups. Finally, interactive Power BI dashboards were created to visualize key trends and generate actionable insights aimed at enhancing user engagement and optimizing product offerings.

<h3 class="major">Key Insights</h3>
The analysis of FitBit data revealed key insights into user activity and sleep patterns, showing an average of 7,640 daily steps, 5.49 km distance covered, and 2,300 calories burned, with a 20% increase in activity on weekends. Sleep efficiency was low, with users spending 182.83 minutes asleep but remaining in bed for 991.21 minutes—50 extra minutes awake—highlighting a need for better sleep hygiene. Most users were Lightly Active, with only a small percentage being Very Active, while sedentary behavior was concerning at over 16 inactive hours per day. A strong correlation was found between steps and calorie burn, reinforcing the benefits of increased physical activity for energy expenditure and overall health.

<h3 class="major">Recommendations</h3>
To improve user health and engagement, FitBit should implement sedentary behavior reminders, prompting users to move after prolonged inactivity, alongside personalized sleep hygiene tips—such as consistent sleep schedules and wind-down routines—to address low sleep efficiency. Additionally, introducing weekend fitness challenges could leverage the observed 20% higher activity levels on weekends, encouraging sustained movement through gamification and community motivation. These strategies aim to reduce sedentary habits, enhance sleep quality, and boost overall activity.

<h3 class="major">Conclusion</h3>
This analysis demonstrates the power of data-driven insights in shaping wellness strategies. By leveraging SQL and Power BI, we’ve uncovered key trends and provided actionable recommendations to enhance Bellabeat’s offerings. With these insights, Bellabeat can continue to innovate and empower women worldwide to lead healthier, more active lives.
